# **App Name**: Ester R&D Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Dashboard Overview: Provides a central hub displaying key metrics, recent activity, and important insights related to polymer research.
- Intelligent Search: Enables users to search across chemicals, polymers, SMILES, CAS numbers, papers, and patents with smart suggestions and filtering to quickly find relevant information. AI "tool" indexes the text.
- Molecules, Polymers, Papers, and Patents Browsing: Allows users to navigate and explore structured data related to molecules, polymers, research papers, and patents.
- Sources Management: Enables administrators to manage data sources, including crawling new sources and whitelisting existing ones.
- Memory Management: Stores notes, highlights, and other important findings to cloud storage.
- Personalized Dashboard Customization: Enables users to customize the dashboard layout and content to focus on their areas of interest and priority.
- Targeted Polymer Suggestions: Provides quick links to explore common interests for the polymer materials researcher, such as "High Tg" or "Bio-derived monomers".

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E40AF) to represent expertise and instill confidence.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F8FAFC) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Analogous blue-violet (#4C2882), contrasting in brightness and saturation, to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Responsive layout with a centered container (max-width: 1280px) and a 12-column grid for desktop, 8-column grid for tablet, and single-column layout for mobile. Sidebar fixed at 260px on desktop, collapsing to an overlay drawer on tablet/mobile.
- Use molecule, beaker, patent, journal, database, tag, filter, bell, folder, gear icons throughout the application.
- Subtle animations for transitions and interactions, providing a smooth user experience.
